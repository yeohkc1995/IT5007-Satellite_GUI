IT5007 Project Work: Map UI for Satellites

Problem Statement

In this era of New Space, where many satellites are being launched (communications, earth observation), how do we know which/when satellites are overhead in our geographical region? For telecommunication companies, it is important for them to know current and future satellite locations to provide better signal coverage.
This App/Webpage aims to provide a user-friendly platform to show everyday users a visual representation of the satellites’ location and trajectory.

Is the problem relevant a year/2-years/5-years/10-years from now?

As space technology becomes more pervasive, companies and nations are looking to launch more satellites (Starlink, OneWeb etc). The number of satellites to track will only increase as according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, with about 5500 active satellites in orbit on Spring 2022, and estimations show an additional 58000 by 2030 [1].

What is the challenging aspect of the problem? Have others not thought of the problem or is the solution difficult to come up with?

Existing open source data only provides primitive satellite information, but does not present the information in a consolidated and processed format.Another challenging aspect would be coming up with the algorithm to predict a satellite’s position in the near future.The Orbitrack is an application that provides comprehensive current satellites’ information.

What is your approach to solving it? What is novel about the solution?

To design a website that pulls specified satellite information and presents the orbits in a user friendly manner. This will allow companies to track, and be aware, when will their satellites be overhead to provide the needed services (e.g. Starlink satellite need to be overhead for communication companies to transmit/receive data)

How will you prevent people from copying your solution? (which you patent it?)
Obfuscation can help to make it difficult for people to copy the code but makes the code harder to maintain. While source code can’t be patented, it can be copyrighted.
